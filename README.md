## boredStats

Tools for data mining and Monte Carlo simulation-based inferential statistics. 

Pandas dataframes are partially supported for now.

### _Requirements_
- numpy
- pandas

Implemented:
- Multi-table PLS-correlation
- PCA - permutation testing for eigenvalues, bootstrap testing for loadings (needs to be cleaned up for readability)

In progress:
- Pandas dataframes support - basic implementation so far, working on returning loadings in dataframes
- pypi distribution - package is currently uploaded to pypi, but is not guaranteed to be current with this repo

Planned:
- Multi-table PLS-regression
- Correspondence Analysis/Multiple Correspondence Analysis + inferential stats
